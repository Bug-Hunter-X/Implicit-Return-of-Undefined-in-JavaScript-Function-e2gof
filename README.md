This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript error related to implicit return values when a function is called with fewer arguments than defined.  The `foo` function expects two arguments but if called with only one, it implicitly returns `undefined`. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application. The solution demonstrates a robust approach to handling missing arguments.
